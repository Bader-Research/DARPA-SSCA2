'include' directory:
sprng_f.h  1. added '#define DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE SPRNG_LFG' since this declaration 
	      was in the file 'interface.h' only, where it was unaccessible
	for Fortran codes at preprocessing time. Should, by symmetry, 
	such declaration be moved from 'interface.h' to 'sprng.h'?

'SRC' directory:
simple_mpi.c 1-6 added lines:     #define SPRNG_LFG   0
                      #define SPRNG_LCG   1                    
                      #define SPRNG_LCG64 2                          
                      #define SPRNG_CMRG  3                           
                      #define SPRNG_MLFG  4                            
                      #define SPRNG_PMLCG 5

'EXAMPLES' directory:
C programs, simple, no MPI:

checkpoint-simpleN.c	1. add DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE to init_sprng

convertN.c    	1. added #define CONVERT to get complilable code
		2. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng
	
pi-simpleN.c    1. changed 'initialize' to 'initialize_function' because of 
		   conflicts, the same name, with libpmlcg.o 
		2. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng  

seed-simpleN.c  1. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng

sprng-simpleN.c  1. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng 
	
simple-simple.c  no changes
	


Fortran programs, simple, no MPI:
checkpointf-simple.F  1.added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng 

convertf.F      1. added #define CONVERT to get complilable code   
           	2. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng
pif-simple.F 	1. changed 'initialize' to 'initialize_function' because of 
		   conflicts with the same name, in libpmlcg.o  
		2. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng
seedf-simple.F	1. added one argument, DEFAULT_RNG_TYPE, to init_sprng

A Fortran compiler on C90 (magnolia) failes when line s are to long:
stream = init_sprng(gtype,streamnum,nstreams,seed,SPRNG_DEFAULT)
Had to move the above slightly to the left in the following source files:
checkpointf.F
messagef_mpi.F
2streamsf_mpi.F ( broke commonstream into two line using &)
